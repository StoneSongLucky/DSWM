# DSWM
The code is related to the paper "Seismic facies analsis via dynamic subwindow matching"

The novel distance called dynamic subwindow matching (DSWM) is to directly calculate the distance between two seismic waveforms with different lengths. A supervised seismic facies analysis method called K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-DSWM is presented for analyzing synthetic seismic data.

To use the paper DSWM, the user has to add the folders "Signal Processing Toolbox" and "S4M" to the Matlab path. Then, any of the syntheticTest1 and syntheticTest2  will be able to run.
